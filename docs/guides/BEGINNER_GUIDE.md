**"I'm not technical, but I want to monitor my solar panels locally"**

This guide is designed for **complete beginners** who want to set up local solar monitoring without relying on SunPower's cloud service.

## What This Guide Will Give You

✅ **Real-time solar data** - See your panels producing power right now  
✅ **Per-panel monitoring** - Know if any individual panel isn't working  
✅ **Historical data** - Track your solar production over time  
✅ **Web dashboard** - Charts and graphs  
✅ **Local control** - No internet required, works offline  
✅ **Better than SunPower** - More data than their official app ever provided  

## What You Need to Know

### Technical Requirements
- **None!** This guide assumes you're not technical
- **Basic computer skills** - downloading files, following instructions
- **Basic tools** - drill, screwdriver (for running cable)
- **2-3 hours** of your time
- **~$100** for hardware

### What You're Building
Think of this as creating a **mini computer** that:
1. **Talks to your solar system** (via Ethernet cable)
2. **Collects data** from all your panels
3. **Shows you charts** on your phone/computer
4. **Works 24/7** without you doing anything

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Understanding What You're Doing (15 minutes)

**The Problem**: SunPower's cloud service is gone, but your solar system still produces data locally.

**The Solution**: A small computer (Raspberry Pi) that connects to your solar system and shows you the data.

**Why This Works**: Your solar system already collects all this data - we're just accessing it directly instead of through SunPower's servers.

### Phase 2: Buying Hardware (30 minutes)

**What You're Buying**: A complete computer system for $100

**Shopping List**:
- **Raspberry Pi 4** - The brain of the system ($65)
- **MicroSD card** - Storage for the computer ($10)
- **Power supply** - Keeps it running ($10)
- **Ethernet cable** - Connects to your solar system ($15-25)
- **Case** - Protects the computer ($10)

**Where to Buy**: Amazon, Adafruit, Micro Center, Best Buy

**Total Cost**: ~$110 (one-time purchase)

### Phase 3: Setting Up the Computer (45 minutes)

**What You're Doing**: Turning a blank computer into a solar monitoring system

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Download software** (Raspberry Pi Imager - free)
2. **Flash the SD card** (like installing Windows on a new computer)
3. **Enable remote access** (so you can control it from your computer)
4. **Boot it up** and find it on your network

**Why This Works**: We're installing a special operating system designed for this purpose.

### Phase 4: Connecting to Your Solar System (60 minutes)

**What You're Doing**: Running a cable from your solar system to your new computer

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Find your PVS6 box** (usually near your electrical panel, outside)
2. **Run Ethernet cable** from PVS6 to your house/garage
3. **Connect cable** to the "LAN" or "Installer" port on PVS6
4. **Connect other end** to your Raspberry Pi
5. **Test the connection** (make sure they can talk to each other)

**Why This Works**: Your solar system has a built-in way to share data - we're just connecting to it.

### Phase 5: Installing the Software (30 minutes)

**What You're Doing**: Installing the solar monitoring program

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Copy the code** to your Raspberry Pi
2. **Install Python** (the programming language)
3. **Install required libraries** (like installing apps on your phone)
4. **Configure the system** (tell it your solar system's address)
5. **Test everything** (make sure it's working)

**Why This Works**: The code is already written - you're just installing it.

### Phase 6: Accessing Your Dashboard (15 minutes)

**What You're Doing**: Viewing your solar data in a web browser

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Open web browser** on any device
2. **Go to your Pi's address** (like going to a website)
3. **See your solar data** in real-time
4. **Bookmark the page** for easy access

**Why This Works**: The Pi creates a website that shows your solar data.

## What You'll See

### Real-Time Dashboard
- **Current power output** - How much power you're making right now
- **Today's production** - Total energy produced today
- **Per-panel status** - Which panels are working and which aren't
- **Historical charts** - See your production over time

### Mobile Access
- **Works on your phone** - Check your solar system anywhere
- **Works on tablets** - Bigger screen for better viewing
- **Works on computers** - Full dashboard experience

## Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

### "I Can't Connect to My Solar System"
**Problem**: The Pi can't talk to your PVS6
**Solution**: Check the Ethernet cable connection
**Prevention**: Make sure cable is securely connected

### "I Can't See the Dashboard"
**Problem**: Web browser can't find the Pi
**Solution**: Check the Pi's IP address
**Prevention**: Write down the IP address when you set it up

### "No Data Is Showing"
**Problem**: Pi isn't collecting data from solar system
**Solution**: Reboot the PVS6 (unplug for 30 seconds)
**Prevention**: Check connections regularly

### "Pi Keeps Turning Off"
**Problem**: Power supply issues
**Solution**: Check power cable connection
**Prevention**: Use official Raspberry Pi power supply

## Maintenance (Keeping It Running)

### Daily
- **Check dashboard** - Make sure data is updating
- **Look for errors** - Any red messages or warnings

### Weekly
- **Check connections** - Make sure cables are secure
- **Review data** - Look for any unusual patterns

### Monthly
- **Clean Pi** - Dust off the case
- **Check for updates** - Update software if needed

### Yearly
- **Replace SD card** - Prevent data loss
- **Check all connections** - Annual maintenance

## Advanced Features (Optional)
