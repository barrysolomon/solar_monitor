- **Home Assistant Integrations** - Community-developed HA components
- **ESPHome Components** - Experimental SunPower data collection
- **Prometheus/Grafana Exporters** - Professional monitoring approaches
- **MQTT Bridges** - Real-time data streaming solutions

### Technical References
- **PVS6 API Documentation** - Community-reverse-engineered API endpoints
- **Network Architecture** - Established networking principles for PVS6 access
- **Hardware Configurations** - Proven Raspberry Pi and Powerline setups
- **Software Patterns** - Standard Python, Flask, SQLite implementations

## Theoretical Basis

The approaches described here are **theoretically sound** because they:

### Proven Concepts
- **Use documented API endpoints** that have been tested by others
- **Follow established networking principles** for PVS6 access
- **Build upon proven hardware configurations** (Raspberry Pi, Powerline adapters)
- **Implement standard software patterns** (Python, Flask, SQLite, etc.)

### Community Validation
- **Multiple implementations** exist using similar approaches
- **Successful deployments** reported by community members
- **Documented results** from various users
- **Ongoing development** and improvement by community

## Use at Your Own Risk

### Safety Considerations
- **Test thoroughly** before deploying in production
- **Follow electrical safety guidelines** when working with solar equipment
- **Backup your data** before making changes
- **Consult professionals** for electrical work if needed
- **Verify compatibility** with your specific PVS6 model and firmware

### Technical Risks
- **Hardware compatibility** may vary between PVS6 models
- **Firmware differences** may affect API access
- **Network configuration** may require adjustment for your setup
- **Software dependencies** may need updates or modifications

### Legal Considerations
- **No warranty** is provided for this software or documentation
- **Use at your own risk** - author assumes no liability
- **Follow local laws** and regulations for electrical work
- **Respect SunPower's intellectual property** - this accesses public API endpoints only

## Contributing and Testing

### If You Successfully Implement This System
- **Share your experience** - What worked, what didn't
- **Report issues** - Help improve the documentation
- **Submit improvements** - Enhance the guides and code
- **Test on different systems** - Verify compatibility across setups
- **Document your setup** - Help others with similar configurations

### Community Contribution
- **Open source approach** - Contribute back to the community
- **Share knowledge** - Help others learn and implement
- **Improve documentation** - Make it better for everyone
- **Test and validate** - Help verify approaches work

## Limitations and Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- **PVS6 API endpoints** remain stable and accessible
- **Network architecture** follows documented patterns
- **Hardware compatibility** with standard components
- **Software dependencies** remain available and compatible

### User Assumptions
- **Basic technical knowledge** for setup and troubleshooting
- **Access to appropriate hardware** (Raspberry Pi, cables, etc.)
