### Option 2: Desktop Computer Setup
**Total Time: 1-2 hours | Cost: ~$8 | Difficulty: Easy**

#### Step 1: Find Hardware (5 minutes)
- Old WiFi router with Ethernet ports - $0 (you already own this!)
- Ethernet cable (10-25 feet) - ~$8
- Your computer - $0 (you already own this!)
- **Total: ~$8**

#### Step 2: Set Up Router Bridge (30 minutes)
1. Connect PVS6 BLUE port to router WAN port via Ethernet
2. Power on router and connect to its WiFi (temporarily)
3. Access router web interface (usually 192.168.1.1)
4. Configure router WiFi to connect to your home network
5. **Important**: Your computer stays connected to your normal home WiFi

#### Step 3: Install Software (45 minutes)
1. Install Python 3.7+ on your computer
2. Download the solar monitoring software
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Test PVS6 connection: `python solar_monitor.py --test-connection`

#### Step 4: Run Monitoring Software (30 minutes)
1. Start data collection: `python solar_monitor.py --mode collector`
2. Start web dashboard: `python solar_monitor.py --mode dashboard`
3. Access dashboard at http://localhost:5000
4. Verify data collection and charts

#### Step 5: Set Up Auto-Start (Optional)
1. Configure as Windows service, macOS launchd, or Linux systemd
2. Set up automatic startup on computer boot
3. Monitor logs and performance

**üéâ Congratulations! You now have local solar monitoring for just $8!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### PVS6 Port Usage
- **Always use the BLUE port** (LAN/Installer) on your PVS6
- **Never use the WHITE port** (WAN/Internet) for local monitoring
- The BLUE port provides full API access to solar data

### Network Requirements
- PVS6 creates an isolated network (172.27.153.x)
- You need a bridge (Pi or router) to access it from your home network
- Direct WiFi connection to PVS6 won't work for monitoring

### Cost Comparison
- **Raspberry Pi**: ~$100 (dedicated device, most reliable)
- **Desktop Computer**: ~$8 (uses existing hardware, budget option)
- **See APPROACH_COMPARISON.md for complete analysis**

## üéØ Quick Decision Guide

### Choose Raspberry Pi If:
- You want a **dedicated monitoring device**
- You want **maximum reliability** and 24/7 operation
- You're comfortable with **basic Linux commands**
- You want **professional, clean setup**

### Choose Desktop Computer If:
- You want to **save money** (~$92 savings)
- You want **quickest setup** (1-2 hours vs 2-3 hours)
- You're comfortable with **Python and software installation**
- You want to **use existing hardware**

## üöÄ Ready to Start?

1. **Choose your approach** (Pi recommended, Desktop for budget)
2. **Follow the steps** above for your chosen approach
3. **Reference detailed guides** if you need help
4. **Enjoy your local solar monitoring!**
